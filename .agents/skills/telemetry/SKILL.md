# Telemetry in the LearnPack IDE

## General architecture

The IDE is the **central telemetry agent**: it accumulates all events, stores them
locally in `localStorage`, and syncs them with Rigobot. The CLI acts as a local
storage bridge for `os`/`vscode` agents.

```
User (action)
    │
    ▼
store.tsx / components
    │  register events via registerTelemetryEvent()
    ▼
TelemetryManager (singleton)       ← src/managers/telemetry.ts
    │  accumulates in .current (in memory)
    ├─ save() → localStorage["TELEMETRY"]   (cloud agent)
    ├─ save() → POST /telemetry             (os/vscode agents)
    └─ submit() → POST Breathecode (batch URL) then POST Rigobot (same JSON body)
```

### Batch vs streaming

**Student progress is carried by the batch blob**, not by the streaming channel.

- Every `registerStepEvent()` updates `TelemetryManager.current`, then **`save()`** (localStorage or CLI file).
- **`submit()`** sends the **full blob** to **`config.telemetry.batch`** (Breathecode) and to **Rigobot** (`/v1/learnpack/telemetry`).
- **`config.telemetry.streaming`** is **optional**. Default LearnPack templates often define only `telemetry.batch`. If `streaming` is missing, `streamEvent()` returns immediately and **no** per-event HTTP firehose runs — the student’s work is still recorded via **`save()`** and **batch `submit()`**.

### The IDE as source of truth for step structure (cloud)

In the cloud environment, the IDE is the **only actor that knows**:
- Which exercises currently exist in the tutorial (from `configObject.exercises`)
- Their current slugs and correct order
- Which steps are testeable

The server stores telemetry blobs but has no knowledge of the tutorial structure.
This means **server data can arrive with steps in a different order or with stale
slugs** if the tutorial was updated between sessions. The IDE must always enforce
the current exercise structure when reconciling.

### Step indexing contract

`current.steps` is a flat array built from `configObject.exercises.map(...)`.
The **array index** is the canonical identifier — `current.steps[N]` always
corresponds to `exercises[N]`.

**All code that accesses `current.steps` must use the array index**, not
`exercise.position`. The two values can diverge if:
- Exercises come from the server with non-sequential position values
- The tutorial was updated and exercises were reordered between sessions

Concretely:
- `registerTelemetryEvent()` → uses `currentExercisePosition` (array index) ✓
- `registerTesteableElement()` → **must use `currentExercisePosition`** (array index), not `exercise.position`. Using `.position` causes testeable elements to land in a different step slot, breaking `hasPendingTasks` checks.

## Main file

**`src/managers/telemetry.ts`** — contains almost all the logic:
- `TelemetryManager` singleton: `start()`, `save()`, `submit()`, `registerStepEvent()`, `reconcileTelemetry()`
- TypeScript types: `ITelemetryJSONSchema`, `TStep`, `TCompilationAttempt`, etc.
- Bootstrap functions, server fetch, base64 encoding

## Event types

| Event | Registered in | Trigger |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| `compile` | `store.tsx` | Compilation result via socket |
| `test` | `store.tsx` | Test result via socket |
| `ai_interaction` | `Rigobot/Agent.tsx`, `Rigobot/NewAgent.tsx` | AI completes response |
| `open_step` | `store.tsx` (guarded by `telemetryReady`) | User navigates to a step |
| `quiz_submission` | `QuizRenderer.tsx`, `Markdowner.tsx`, `OpenQuestion.tsx` | User submits quiz |

Additionally, `LessonRenderer.tsx` emits the `lesson_rendered` eventBus event whenever
`currentContent` changes. This is not a `registerStepEvent` call — it's an internal
signal used by `onLessonRendered` to detect read-only steps (see below).

## How to register a new event

1. Call `TelemetryManager.registerStepEvent(stepPosition, eventType, data)` from the component/store (via `registerTelemetryEvent` in the store)
2. The event is appended to the corresponding array in `TelemetryManager.current.steps[n]`
3. `save()` is called automatically after each registration
4. Add the new type to `TStep` (see `references/schema.md`)

For compilation/test events, data must be base64-encoded (see `stringToBase64` / `fixStepData` in `src/managers/telemetry.ts`).

## Lifecycle and submission triggers

**Bootstrap** (cloud agent — `TelemetryManager.start`):
1. Load prior blob from `localStorage` (same tutorial slug only)
2. `GET ${RIGOBOT_HOST}/v1/learnpack/telemetry?...` with `user_ids`, `package_slug`, `include_buffer=true`, `include_steps=true` — 5s timeout (`FETCH_TELEMETRY_TIMEOUT_MS`)
3. `reconcileTelemetry()` (see Reconciliation section)
4. Apply session fields (`user_id`, `fullname`, `cohort_id`, `academy_id`), `save()`, then if reconciliation source is `"local"`, **`submit()`** immediately

**`package_id` — optional Rigobot lookup and merge (not part of `start()` itself):**
- The persisted blob may already contain `package_id` (localStorage, server GET, or prior sessions). It is **whitelisted** (`TELEMETRY_WHITELIST_KEYS`).
- When missing or empty, the IDE resolves the LearnPack package record **via HTTP**: `getPackageBySlug()` → `GET ${RIGOBOT_HOST}/v1/learnpack/package/<slug>/` (same path used for `asset_ids`; see `references/apis.md`). The response `id` is stored in Zustand as **`packageId` + `packageIdSlug`** (`src/utils/store.tsx` / `storeTypes.ts`).
- **`PackageMetadataListener`** (`src/components/PackageMetadataListener.tsx`, mounted in `App.tsx`) runs when **Rigobot token + config slug** are set; it calls **`fetchPackageMetadata()`**, which skips the network if the slug still matches the cached `packageIdSlug` with a non-null `packageId`, otherwise fetches and calls **`TelemetryManager.mergePackageIdIfMissing(idStr)`**.
- **`startTelemetry()`** after `await TelemetryManager.start(...)` calls **`mergePackageIdIfMissing(pkgId)`** again if the store already has `packageId` — this covers ordering where metadata resolved before telemetry finished bootstrapping.
- **`mergePackageIdIfMissing`** only writes when `current.package_id` is missing/empty; it always stores a **string** (`String(packageId)`). The schema allows `number | string`; the IDE normalizes new fills to **string**.
- **Course change:** inside **`fetchExercises`**, if the incoming config slug **differs** from the previous non-empty slug, the store clears **`packageId` / `packageIdSlug`** so the next listener/metadata pass targets the new package.

**`submit()` — dual batch POST (same body, strict order):**
1. `POST` **`config.telemetry.batch`** with **Breathecode** token (`Authorization: Token <breathecode_token>`).
2. If that succeeds, `POST` **`${RIGOBOT_HOST}/v1/learnpack/telemetry`** with **Rigobot** token.

If the Breathecode POST **throws**, the Rigobot POST is **not** attempted (single `try` / sequential `await`).

When **both** POSTs succeed, `submit()` copies **`global_metrics`** and **`global_indicators`** from the same payload object produced by **`buildSubmitPayload`** into **`TelemetryManager.current`**, then **`save()`**, so localStorage/CLI reflect the latest computed aggregates after a successful dual submit.

**When `submit()` runs** (non-exhaustive):
- After **`test`** when `exit_code === 0` (and related completion logic)
- After **`quiz_submission`**
- After **`open_step`**
- Cloud: when the tab becomes **hidden** (`visibilitychange` → `TelemetryManager.submit()`)

**Page unload — Rigobot-only beacon:**

On `beforeunload` / `pagehide` (cloud), `submitTelemetryToRigobotViaBeacon()` sends **one** `fetch` with **`keepalive: true`** to **Rigobot only**. It does **not** call the Breathecode batch URL. This is a best-effort last send when the page is tearing down; the hidden-tab `submit()` path is what reliably hits **both** backends during normal navigation.

**Server refresh:**
- On tab focus if idle > 5 minutes (`TELEMETRY_VISIBILITY_REFRESH_IDLE_MS`) — refetch Rigobot telemetry and merge via `normalizeTelemetrySchema` when server `last_interaction_at` is newer

## Local ↔ server reconciliation

Function: `reconcileTelemetry()` — `src/managers/telemetry.ts` (`export function reconcileTelemetry`)

Strategy: **"most recent `last_interaction_at` wins"**

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Server only | Use server data |
| Local only | Use local + auto-submit to server |
| Both have data | Most recent wins; tie → server |
| Neither | Create new blob with UUID |

### Step merge on reconciliation (`normalizeTelemetrySchema`)

After choosing a winner blob, steps are **not** used as-is. They are merged into
`freshSteps` (the current exercise list) by `slug`:

- **Structural fields** (`slug`, `position`, `files`, `is_testeable`) always come
  from `freshSteps` — this enforces correct array ordering.
- **Activity fields** (`compilations`, `tests`, `ai_interactions`, `quiz_submissions`,
  `testeable_elements`, `is_completed`, `completed_at`, `opened_at`, `sessions`)
  are preserved from the stored blob when present.
- Steps in the stored blob that have no matching slug in `freshSteps` are discarded.
- Steps in `freshSteps` with no match in the stored blob get blank defaults.

## Local storage

- **Cloud**: `localStorage["TELEMETRY"]` — PII sanitized (FERPA): `fullname → "[REDACTED]"`, email removed
- **OS/VSCode**: `POST http://localhost:PORT/telemetry` → saved to `${configPath}/telemetry.json` in the CLI

## External APIs

See `references/apis.md` for full endpoints, headers, and payloads.

## Data schema

See `references/schema.md` for the complete TypeScript types with all fields.

## Key files

See `references/key-files.md` for the full file map with relevant line numbers.

## Privacy

- `fullname` → `"[REDACTED]"` in localStorage (`src/utils/piiSanitizer.ts:85-88`)
- Email is **never** sent in telemetry
- `user.email`, `user.first_name`, `user.last_name`, `user.github` removed from localStorage
- No explicit opt-out mechanism; without a Rigobot token, no data is sent to the server

## How `is_completed` gets set (state machine)

`step.is_completed` and `step.completed_at` are always set together. There are five paths:

| Path | Mechanism | Key conditions |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Test passes | `case "test"` | `exit_code === 0` AND `!hasPendingTasks(pos)` AND `!step.completed_at` |
| Quiz succeeds | `case "quiz_submission"` | `status === "SUCCESS"` AND no other active pending elements AND `!step.completed_at` |
| Navigate away from step | `case "open_step"` — auto-completes **previous** step | `prev.testeable_elements?.length > 0` AND `!hasPendingTasks(prevStep)` AND `!prev.completed_at` |
| Read-only step (any step) | `onLessonRendered` → `completeStepIfReadOnly` — 7s debounce after `lesson_rendered` | `!step.testeable_elements?.length` AND `!step.is_testeable` AND `!step.completed_at` |
| Last step — user clicks Finish | `completeStepIfReadOnly` via `last_lesson_finished` in eventListener | Same as above — safety net if 7s debounce hasn't fired yet |

**Critical:** `open_step` only auto-completes the previous step if `testeable_elements`
is **non-empty**. Steps with empty `testeable_elements` are never completed by departure
— they rely exclusively on `onLessonRendered` (7s debounce) to decide if they're
read-only. This prevents a race condition where a quiz step whose components haven't
mounted yet looks indistinguishable from a read-only step.

### `completeStepIfReadOnly`

Called from `onLessonRendered` (for all steps) and from the `last_lesson_finished`
handler (safety net for the last step). It is a no-op if:
- `step.completed_at` already set (already completed via quiz/test)
- `step.testeable_elements?.length > 0` (has registered quiz/test elements — not read-only)
- `step.is_testeable === true` (code-test step whose element may not have registered yet)

### `onLessonRendered`

Listens to the `lesson_rendered` eventBus event. On each emission:
1. Cancels any pending debounce (prevents stale completions from previous step)
2. Schedules `completeStepIfReadOnly(stepPosition)` with a **7-second debounce**

The 7s window gives quiz/FITB/OQ components time to mount, compute their hashes,
and call `registerTesteableElement`. If no elements are registered after 7s, the
step is genuinely read-only and gets marked complete.

**Diagnosing `is_completed` bugs:**
- Stays `false` unexpectedly → check `hasPendingTasks`: any stale/orphaned element?
  Is `testeable_elements` in the correct step slot (array index)? Did `registerTesteableElement`
  run before or after `registerStepEvent`?
- Set `true` unexpectedly → was `open_step` fired before `testeable_elements` was
  populated (race condition)? Check `telemetryReady` guard. Did `onLessonRendered`
  fire 7s after a step that had slow quiz registration?

## `testeable_elements` and `hasPendingTasks`

`testeable_elements` is a per-step array of trackable sub-tasks (quiz questions,
code tests). The step is only complete when all active items are done.

### `hasPendingTasks(stepPosition)` — logic

```
1. If testeable_elements is empty → return false (no tasks, nothing pending)
2. If any element with type === "test" is incomplete → return true
3. Filter quiz elements. If none → return false
4. For each language in activeHashes:
     collect the hashes of this step that appear in that language's set
     if all of them are is_completed === true → return false  (OR logic: one complete language = done)
5. return true  (no language found where all active quizzes are done)
```

**Key behavior:** `hasPendingTasks` uses **OR logic across languages** — the step is
considered done if ALL active quiz hashes of **at least one language** are completed.
Orphaned hashes (not in `activeHashes`) are completely ignored.

### `hasPendingTasksInAnyLesson()` — logic

Does **not** delegate to `hasPendingTasks`. Uses `is_completed` directly:

```typescript
return steps.some(step =>
  (step.is_testeable || step.testeable_elements?.length) && !step.is_completed
)
```

This avoids any dependency on `activeHashes` (in-memory, session-only) and works
correctly for all steps, including those not visited in the current session.

**The sidebar** (`ExercisesList.tsx`) uses `TelemetryManager.isStepCompleted(position)`
(reads `step.is_completed` from persisted data) instead of `hasPendingTasks`, which
requires in-memory session state only available for the currently rendered step.

### The double-call pattern

For quizzes and tests, a single "user completed X" maps to two calls:

```
registerTelemetryEvent(event, data)      → records attempt, checks hasPendingTasks,
                                           may set is_completed, calls submit()

registerTesteableElement(index, element) → updates testeable_elements cache,
                                           calls save() only (NOT submit())
```

`registerStepEvent` runs synchronously and reads `testeable_elements` **before**
`registerTesteableElement` updates it. When diagnosing completion bugs, always
check the call order in the triggering code.

**The fix for quiz completion** (`case "quiz_submission"`): instead of `hasPendingTasks()`
(which would include the current quiz's stale element), check only OTHER active elements:
`step.testeable_elements?.some(e => e.hash !== data.quiz_hash && !e.is_completed)`.

## Course completion architecture

### Layer 1 — `step.completed_at` (metrics source of truth)

`metrics.ts` derives step status from `step.completed_at`, **not** `step.is_completed`:

```typescript
let status = step.completed_at ? "completed" : step.opened_at ? "attempted" : "unread";
```

If `completed_at` is missing, the step is never counted in `completion_rate`.

### Layer 2 — `hasPendingTasks` / `hasPendingTasksInAnyLesson` (real-time gate)

- `hasPendingTasks(stepPosition)` — language-aware, `activeHashes`-filtered check for the **current rendered step**
- `hasPendingTasksInAnyLesson()` — reads `is_completed` directly; works for all steps including unvisited ones

### Layer 3 — "Finish" button and last_lesson_finished modal

```
isFinishDisabled = isLastExercise && (hasPendingTasks || hasPendingTasksInAnyLesson)
```

When the student clicks Finish: `eventBus.emit("last_lesson_finished")` →
`EventListener` re-checks `hasPendingTasksInAnyLesson()` → confetti + modal.

### Layer 4 — `completion_rate` in the telemetry payload

```typescript
completion_rate = (steps_with_completed_at / total_steps) * 100
```

## Hash generation per testeable element type

Each testeable element is identified by a SHA-256 hash (`asyncHashText`, `lib.tsx:361`):

| Type | Input to `asyncHashText` |
|------|--------------------------|
| **Quiz (MCQ)** | `renderedGroups.join(" ")` — rendered group titles (`QuizRenderer.tsx`) |
| **Open question** | `metadata.eval` — the `eval` attribute string (`Markdowner.tsx`) |
| **Fill-in-the-blank** | `buildFillInTheBlankIdentityString(code, metadata)` — format: `fitb:<code>:<idx>=<answer>\|...` |

All three types are **language-sensitive**: hash inputs come from README content,
which is fetched per locale. The same element in a different language produces a
different hash.

### Known limitation: content edits orphan progress

Any text change to quiz content produces a new hash. The old element stays in
`testeable_elements` with its previous `is_completed` state. The student loses
visible progress on that question. Orphaned elements are ignored by `hasPendingTasks`
(via `activeHashes` filter) so they don't block completion, but they accumulate over
time.

### `activeHashes` — in-memory orphan filter

`TelemetryManager.activeHashes: Map<language, Set<hash>>` — **not persisted**,
rebuilt each session as quiz components mount.

**How it works:**
- `registerTesteableElement` adds the hash to `activeHashes[language]` when
  `type === "quiz"` and a language is provided.
- `hasPendingTasks` iterates `activeHashes` entries and applies OR logic across
  languages (see above). Hashes not in any language's set are ignored.
- Code tests (`type: "test"`) are never orphaned — they are always evaluated
  regardless of `activeHashes`.

`activeHashes` is reset to an empty `Map` at the start of each `TelemetryManager.start()`
call, preventing hash leakage when switching courses in the same tab.

## Multi-language progress in `testeable_elements`

Quiz elements (MCQ, open question, FITB) produce different hashes per language.
Progress per language is tracked independently via `TTesteableElement.language`.

- `language` is set on registration for `type === "quiz"` elements by `QuizRenderer.tsx`,
  `Markdowner.tsx` (FITB), and `OpenQuestion.tsx`. Omitted for `type: "test"`.
- `hasPendingTasks` uses OR logic: if ALL active hashes of **at least one language**
  are completed, the step is done. This means completing a course in Spanish does not
  require having also completed quizzes in English.
- `hasPendingTasksInAnyLesson()` reads `step.is_completed` directly and is not
  affected by language at all.
- Legacy stored elements without `language` (from before multi-language support) are
  treated as matching every language check — they will block completion in any locale
  until re-answered.

**If completion looks wrong in a multi-language course:**
1. Inspect `step.testeable_elements` — confirm quiz rows include `language`.
2. Check that `registerTesteableElement` is being called with the `language` argument
   in `QuizRenderer.tsx`, `Markdowner.tsx`, `OpenQuestion.tsx`.
3. Legacy rows without `language` can block completion across locales.

## workout_session mechanics

`workout_session` is an array of `{ started_at, ended_at? }` objects tracking study periods.
Each `TelemetryManager.start()` call closes the previous session (sets `ended_at =
last_interaction_at` if no `ended_at`) and opens a new one. Handled by
`normalizeWorkoutSession()` inside `normalizeTelemetrySchema`.

## Important gotchas

- **`open_step` is guarded by `telemetryReady`** — `setPosition` only fires
  `open_step` when `telemetryReady === true`. This prevents a 2s retry from being
  enqueued before `TelemetryManager.start()` completes, which could trigger completion
  logic with stale state. `startTelemetry()` registers the initial `open_step` itself.

- **Race condition: `startTelemetry` + `getOrCreateActiveSession`** — both are called
  concurrently on startup. If `getOrCreateActiveSession` resolves after telemetry is
  ready and calls `setPosition(N)` for the same step that's already open, `open_step(N)`
  fires with `prevStep === N === stepPosition`. The guard `this.prevStep !== stepPosition`
  prevents this from triggering auto-completion.

- **`open_step` never completes steps with empty `testeable_elements`** — read-only step
  completion relies on `onLessonRendered` (7s debounce). Never add completion logic to
  `open_step` for steps with `testeable_elements.length === 0` — it cannot distinguish
  a read-only step from a quiz step whose components haven't mounted yet.

- **`TelemetryManager` may not be initialized when the first event fires** → retry loop
  of 3 attempts with 2s delay. Note: `open_step` is excluded from this retry mechanism
  via the `telemetryReady` guard in `setPosition`.

- **Keys persisted in localStorage have a strict whitelist** (`TELEMETRY_WHITELIST_KEYS` in `src/managers/telemetry.ts`) —
  fields outside the whitelist are discarded during normalization.

- **No HTTP retry**: if a POST fails, it is logged and discarded.

- **Source code, stdout, and stderr are always base64-encoded.**

- **Never use `exercise.position` to index `current.steps`** — always use the array
  index. `exercise.position` can differ from the array index if the tutorial was
  reordered or the server returned steps out of order.

- **`step.completed_at` is the real source of truth** for metrics — `metrics.ts` only
  reads `completed_at`. If debugging why a step doesn't count in `completion_rate`,
  check `completed_at`, not `is_completed`.

- **`hasPendingTasksInAnyLesson()` blocks the entire course** — a single step with
  `is_completed: false` and `is_testeable || testeable_elements.length` will prevent
  the Finish button and completion modal, even for unvisited steps.

- **`console.log` objects in browser devtools show live references** — expanding an
  object in the console shows its *current* state, not the state at log time. When
  debugging `is_completed` mutations, always log the primitive value separately
  (`console.log(step.is_completed)`) alongside the object to get an accurate snapshot.
