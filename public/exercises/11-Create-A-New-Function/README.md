# `11` Create a New Function

As you know, functions are useful blocks of code that you can re-use as many times as you need. In the last exercise, you had a function that received two parameters (two inputs) and returned the sum of those. Like this:

```py
def add_numbers(a, b):
    print(a + b)
```

But Python comes with a bunch of "pre-defined" functions that you can use, for example:

```py
import random
# Generates a random number between a given positive range

r1 = random.randint(0, 10)
print("Random number between 0 and 10 is % s" % (r1))
```

You can use the `randint()` function to get a random whole number. `randint()` is an inbuilt function of the **random module** in Python3. 

The **random module** gives access to various useful functions, one of them being able to generate random numbers, which is `randint()`.

## üìù Instructions:

1. Please now create a function called `generate_random` that returns a random number between 0 and 9 every time it is called.

2. Print the result that the function call returns. 

## üí° Hints:

+ One possible solution involves using one out of two predefined functions: the `randint()` or `randrange()` functions.

+ Don't forget to import the `random` module.

+ You can check the documentation here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#functions-for-integers
