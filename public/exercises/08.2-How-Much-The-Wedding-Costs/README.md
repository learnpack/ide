# `08.2` How Much The Wedding Costs (if...else)

Here is a table of prices for a wedding catering company:

| # of guests           | price     |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| Up to 50 people       | $4,000    |
| Up to 100 people      | $10,000   |
| Up to 200 people      | $15,000   |
| More than 200 people  | $20,000   |

> Note: The quantities in the table include the specified number. For example, "Up to 50 people" is inclusive of 50.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Complete the algorithm that prompts the user for the number of people attending their wedding and prints the corresponding price in the console. 
2. Extend the given code on the left to cover all possible ranges of guests. 
3. Make sure that your code correctly calculates and prints the price in the console based on the user's input.

For example, if the user says that `20` people are attending to the wedding, it must cost `$4,000` dollars.

## 💡 Hint:

+ Use `if...else` to divide your code and set the value of the `price` variable the right way.
