# `15` Looping With FizzBuzz

This is a typical beginner test that is required to complete interviews at Google, Facebook and all the other big tech companies.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write the code needed to print in the console all the numbers from 1 to 100.
  
2. For multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Fizz".
 
3. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz". 

4. For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

## 💻 Expected result:

```py
1

Buzz
Fizz

Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz

```


## 🔎 Important: 

There's a series of exercises dedicated to Lists and Loops, we encourage you to go and finish them before continuing: [https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-lists-loops-programming-exercises](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-lists-loops-programming-exercises) 

Then, come back! 😊

## 💡 Hint:

+ You have to use multiple `if` statements.

+ Think about the correct order of the different `if` statements to make the code do what you want.
