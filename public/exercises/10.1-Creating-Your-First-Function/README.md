# `10.1` Creating Your First Function

## 📝 Instructions:

1. The function `add_numbers` is supposed to return the sum of 2 given numbers, please complete the needed code inside the function to make it behave as expected.

2. The exercise should print the number 7 in the console.

## 💡 Hint:

+ There is a function `add_numbers` already declared, it receives 2 parameters (variables `a` and `b`). As a developer, you were given the task to fill the function's body with the code needed to sum variable `a` with variable `b` and return the result of that operation.
