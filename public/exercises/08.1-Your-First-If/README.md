# `08.1` Your First If...

The current application is asking how much money the user has. Once the user inputs the amount, we need to **print** one of the following answers:

## 📝 Instructions:

1. If the user has more than $100, we answer: "Give me your money!".

2. If the user has more than $50, we answer: "Buy me some coffee, you cheap!".

3. If the user has less than or equal to $50, we answer: "You are a poor guy, go away!".

## 💡 Hints:

+ Use an `if...else` statement to check the value of the `total` variable.

+ Further information [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements).

+ Here's a quick reminder on relational operators:

  | Operator | Description                                                            | Syntax    |
  |----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
  | >        | Greater than: True if the left operand is greater than the right       | x > y     |
  | <        | Less than: True if the left operand is less than the right             | x < y     |
  | ==       | Equal to: True if both operands are equal                              | x == y    |
  | !=       | Not equal to: True if operands are not equal                           | x != y    |
  | >=       | Greater than or equal to: True if the left operand is greater or equal | x >= y    |
  | <=       | Less than or equal to: True if the left operand is less or equal       | x <= y    |
