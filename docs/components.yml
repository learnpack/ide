components:
  - name: open-text-question
    description: >-
      The open text question is a type of interactive question where users can write down a text answer (1-5 sentences). The component consists in a markdown code block with the language set to `question` and has a metadata property eval in the metadata section of the code block with instructions on how to evaluate the answer. Inside the code block, you must write down 3-5 example answers with CORRECT: or INCORRECT: prefix.
    goodFor: reflection, explanation, recall
    avoid: multiple choice, true/false, fill in the blank, this component is intended only for free form answers
    props:
      - eval: string (required)
    example: |
      ```question eval="The user needs to write using its own words what is console.log"
      CORRECT: The console.log is a function that logs a message to the console.
      INCORRECT: It is used to solve logarithms problems.
      CORRECT: It prints things to the console.  
      ```

  - name: multiple-choice-question
    intentedUse: evaluation, knowledge assessment
    description: >-
      This is a set of questions, from 1 to 5 questions, each one with multiple options. The component leverages task-list syntax to render the quiz. Each group of options should have a question title separated by an empty line from the options. Each option should be indented by 3 to 6 spaces for proper parsing from markdown to HTML.
    goodFor: reflection, explanation, recall, knowledge assessment
    avoid: open text question, this component is intended only for multiple choice answers
    rules:
      - Each group of options should have a question title separated by an empty line from the options
      - Each group of options must have a unique correct answer
      - Each option should be a checkbox indented by 3 to 6 spaces
      - There must be an empty line between the question title and the options
      - Use [x] for correct answers and [ ] for incorrect options
    example: |
      1. What is the purpose of HTML?

         - [ ] To write code
         - [x] To create websites
         - [ ] To create a database

      2. What is the purpose of CSS?

         - [ ] To create websites
         - [x] To style websites
         - [ ] To create a database

  - name: mermaid-diagram
    intentedUse: explanation, complementary to the main content
    description: >-
      Mermaid diagrams allow you to create various types of diagrams including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and more. The component renders Mermaid syntax into interactive diagrams.
    goodFor: visualization, process explanation, system architecture, data flow.
    whenToUse: Use it only when the diagram
    avoid: complex diagrams that might not render well, use for simple to medium complexity diagrams
    rules: 
      - NEVER under ANY circumstances use write parentheses inside [] because it will break the mermaid syntax and won't render properly
    example: |
      ```mermaid
      graph TD
          A[Start] --> B{Is it working?}
          B -->|Yes| C[Great!]
          B -->|No| D[Debug]
          D --> B
      ```

  - name: ask-rigo-button
    intentedUse: explanation, complementary to the main content
    description: >-
      The Ask Rigo button provides AI-powered assistance for quizzes and tests. It allows users to get hints and help from the Rigo AI assistant based on the current context. It consist in a link that starts with https://4geeks.com/ask?query= and the query is the current question to make to the Rigo AI assistant.
    goodFor: providing hints, AI assistance, learning support
    avoid: overuse, should be used sparingly to encourage independent thinking
    usage: Automatically appears in quiz and test components, no manual configuration needed
    example: |
      [Ask Rigo about HTML](https://4geeks.com/ask?query=What is the purpose of HTML?)

  - name: runnable-code
    intentedUse: code experimentation, immediate feedback, understand code.
    description: >-
      Code blocks with the runnable metadata that can be executed directly in the browser. Users can run the code and see the output, making it interactive for learning programming concepts.
    goodFor: code experimentation, immediate feedback, understand code.
    avoid: complex code that might not run in the browser environment easily, this is intended only for demostrative purposes.
    example: |
      ```javascript runnable="true"
      console.log("Hello, World!");
      let x = 5;
      let y = 10;
      console.log(x + y);
      ```

  - name: code-file-proposal
    intentedUse: hands-on learning, code experimentation, immediate feedback on code execution, this renders in a separate tab where the student can edit the code file. The student will see all the files from the lessons. So you need to suggest as many files as needed for the exercise.
    description: >-
      A code file proposal is a component the teacher will use to generate a coding files used to solve an exercise in the instructions, it consists in a markdown code block with the language set to `code-file-proposal`. Inside the code block, you must write a 5 to 10 sentences description of the exercise. It has a metadata property file_name in the metadata section of the code block with the name of the file to be generated, including  the extension. Keep in mind that for HTML, CSS and Javascript files, the code is executed directly in the browser, for other programming languages, the code executing will be inferred by an AI model. Prefer a single file instead of multiple ones per lesson. But if multiple files are needed, suggest them all.
    goodFor: hands-on learning, code experimentation, immediate feedback on code execution, this renders in a separate tab where the student can edit the code file. The student will see all the files from the lessons. So you need to suggest as many files as needed for the exercise.
    avoid: complex code that might not be inferred correctly by an AI model. 
    example: |
      ```code-file-proposal file_name="app.js"
      In this file, the student needs to complete a function "multiply" that multiplies two numbers and print the result to the console.
      ```

      ```code-file-proposal file_name="app.css"
      In this file, the student needs to style the HTML page with CSS.
      ```

      ```code-file-proposal file_name="app.html"
      In this file, the student needs to create a simple HTML page with a title and a paragraph. This page is linked to the app.css file and the app.js files.
      ```
  - name: fill-in-the-blank
    intentedUse: reflection, explanation, recall, knowledge assessment
    description: >-
      A fill in the blank is a component that allows the user to fill in the blank with the correct answer. It consists in a markdown code block with the language set to `fill-in-the-blank`. Inside the code block, you must write the question with the blank (or blanks) to be filled. In the metadata section, you must include the valid answers for each blank. The blanks are numbered starting from 1. Case insensitive answers are allowed. If multiple answer are alloed for a blank, you must include them separated by a comma in the proper metadata property.
    goodFor: reflection, explanation, recall, knowledge assessment
    avoid: open text question, this component is intended only for fill in the blank answers
    example: |
      ### Let's recall!
      FIll the blanks with the correct answers.
      
      ```fill-in-the-blank 1="Paris" 2="Berlin"
      The capital of France is _1_, the capital of Germany is _2_.
      ```

      ### Are you really learning? Let's check it!

      Complete the sentence with number of hours of sleep per day that are recommended based on the lesson.

      ```fill-in-the-blank 1="7,8,9,10" 
      I need to sleep at least _1_ hours a day to be healthy.
      ```
