    description: >-
      Mermaid diagrams allow you to create various types of diagrams including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and more. The component renders Mermaid syntax into interactive diagrams.
    goodFor:
      - visualization
      - process explanation
      - system architecture
      - data flow
    whenToUse: Use it only when the diagram
    avoid:
      - complex diagrams that might not render well
      - use for simple to medium complexity diagrams
    rules:
      - NEVER under ANY circumstances use or write parentheses inside [] because it will break the mermaid syntax and won't render properly
    example: |
      ```mermaid
      graph TD
          A[Start] --> B{Is it working?}
          B -->|Yes| C[Great!]
          B -->|No| D[Debug]
          D --> B

      The Ask Rigo button provides AI-powered assistance for quizzes and tests. It allows users to get hints and help from the Rigo AI assistant based on the current context. It consist in a link that starts with https://4geeks.com/ask?query= and the query is the current question to make to the Rigo AI assistant. Keep in mind that the query must be always in this syntax: this-is-a-question. The question should be in lower case and without special characters, separated by hyphens. The question should be good enough to  guide the AI to provide a meaningful answer, not just a vague question, provide specific details on what and how to explain to the student.
    goodFor:
      - providing hints
      - AI assistance
      - learning support
    avoid:
      - overuse
      - should be used sparingly to encourage independent thinking

  - name: technical_diagram
    intendedUse:
      - technical explanation with structural relationships
      - system architecture and component interactions
      - data structure visualizations
    description: >-
      Technical diagrams show the structure and relationships between technical components.
      They use precise lines, boxes, arrows, and labels to illustrate how systems, APIs,
      databases, or code structures are organized and connected. Focus on clarity and
      technical accuracy with a clean, professional aesthetic.
    visualStyle: >-
      Clean technical diagram with precise lines, clear component boundaries,
      labeled connections, professional color scheme (blues and grays),
      flat design, modern technical illustration style, vector-like appearance
    goodFor:
      - system architecture diagrams
      - network topology and API interactions
      - database schema and relationships
      - component dependency diagrams
      - data flow between systems
    whenToUse: When explaining HOW technical components are structured, connected, or interact within a system. Use when the focus is on technical relationships and architecture.
    avoid:
      - purely decorative technical imagery
      - overly complex diagrams (consider mermaid instead)
      - sequential processes (use mermaid flowchart)
      - realistic representations (use realistic_photography instead)
    rules:
      - Must use standard markdown image syntax => ![alt text](image-url)
      - Alt text must contain at least 30 words describing components and relationships
      - Must specify visual elements, e.g. "labeled with", "arrows showing", "color-coded"
      - Image URL must start with "./.learn/assets/"
      - Must include clear labels for each component
      - Must show connections/relationships with arrows or lines
      - Use consistent visual language (boxes for components, cylinders for databases, etc.)
    example: |
      ![Technical architecture diagram showing a three-tier web application with labeled components: React frontend in blue box at top, connecting via arrow labeled "REST API (HTTPS)" to Node.js backend in green box at center, which connects via arrow labeled "SQL queries" to PostgreSQL database shown as gray cylinder at bottom, with annotations explaining data flow and each layer's responsibility](./.learn/assets/three-tier-architecture.png)

  - name: conceptual_illustration
    intendedUse:
      - abstract concept visualization
      - metaphorical representation of programming ideas
      - simplified educational illustrations
    description: >-
      Conceptual illustrations transform abstract programming concepts into visual metaphors
      and simplified representations. They use friendly, approachable aesthetics with flat
      colors and minimal details to make complex ideas accessible. Focus on clarity and
      educational value through visual metaphors.
    visualStyle: >-
      Simplified illustration style, flat colors, minimal details, friendly and approachable
      aesthetic, vector art style with smooth shapes, focus on clarity over realism,
      educational and welcoming visual language
    goodFor:
      - abstract programming concepts (closures, scope, inheritance)
      - memory models and heap/stack visualization
      - conceptual relationships between ideas
      - visual metaphors for complex topics
      - explaining "how things work" conceptually
    whenToUse: When the concept is abstract and benefits from a metaphorical or highly simplified visual representation. Use when realism would be confusing and a friendly illustration helps understanding.
    avoid:
      - technical accuracy over clarity (use technical_diagram instead)
      - realistic depictions (use realistic_photography instead)
      - step-by-step processes (use mermaid flowchart instead)
      - purely decorative or artistic images without educational purpose
    rules:
      - Must use standard markdown image syntax => ![alt text](image-url)
      - Alt text must contain at least 30 words describing the concept and visual metaphor
      - Must specify visual elements, e.g. "shown as", "represented by", "color-coded to differentiate"
      - Image URL must start with "./.learn/assets/"
      - Should simplify complex ideas into basic visual metaphors
      - Use color coding to differentiate concept categories
      - Include annotations that bridge the metaphor to the actual concept
    example: |
      ![Conceptual illustration of JavaScript closure using nested container metaphor: outer function shown as large blue box labeled "Outer Function Scope" containing variable boxes (x, y), with inner function as smaller orange box labeled "Inner Function" inside it, arrows pointing from inner to outer variables with label "maintains access to", simplified flat design with friendly colors and clear annotations explaining the closure relationship](./.learn/assets/closure-concept.png)

  - name: realistic_photography
    intendedUse:
      - realistic representations of physical objects, environments, or interfaces
      - professional scenarios and workplace contexts
      - hardware, equipment, or tangible items
    description: >-
      Realistic photography provides photorealistic depictions when concepts require
      real-world context or physical representation. Uses professional photography style
      with proper lighting, depth, and realistic details. Appropriate when illustration
      would lose important real-world context.
    visualStyle: >-
      Professional photography style, realistic lighting and shadows, proper depth of field,
      clean and organized composition, neutral professional background, high-quality
      photorealistic rendering, appropriate for educational or professional contexts
    goodFor:
      - hardware setup and physical equipment
      - workspace and development environment examples
      - real user interfaces and application screenshots
      - professional workplace scenarios
      - physical objects relevant to development (keyboards, monitors, servers)
      - real-world contexts that require authenticity
    whenToUse: When the educational value requires showing real-world physical objects, professional environments, or when authenticity and realism are essential to understanding. Use when abstraction would remove important context.
    avoid:
      - generic stock photos without educational value
      - purely decorative realistic images
      - when a diagram or illustration would be clearer
      - complex technical relationships (use technical_diagram instead)
      - abstract concepts (use conceptual_illustration instead)
    rules:
      - Must use standard markdown image syntax => ![alt text](image-url)
      - Alt text must contain at least 30 words describing the scene and its educational purpose
      - Must specify what to show realistically and why it matters
      - Image URL must start with "./.learn/assets/"
      - Should include context that explains the educational relevance
      - If showing UI/screens, specify what elements to highlight or annotate
      - Maintain professional, clean aesthetic appropriate for learning
    example: |
      ![Professional photograph of a modern developer workspace showing a dual-monitor setup with code editor on left screen and browser developer tools on right screen, mechanical keyboard in foreground, with natural lighting from window, clean desk organization, demonstrating a typical full-stack development environment with annotations highlighting the debugging workflow between IDE and browser](./.learn/assets/developer-workspace.png)
