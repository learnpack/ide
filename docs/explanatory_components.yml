      Mermaid diagrams allow you to create various types of diagrams including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and more. The component renders Mermaid syntax into interactive diagrams.
    goodFor:
      - visualization
      - process explanation
      - system architecture
      - data flow
    whenToUse: Use it only when the diagram
    avoid:
      - complex diagrams that might not render well
      - use for simple to medium complexity diagrams
    rules:
      - NEVER under ANY circumstances use or write parentheses inside [] because it will break the mermaid syntax and won't render properly
    example: |
      ```mermaid
      graph TD
          A[Start] --> B{Is it working?}
          B -->|Yes| C[Great!]
          B -->|No| D[Debug]
          D --> B

      The Ask Rigo button provides AI-powered assistance for quizzes and tests. It allows users to get hints and help from the Rigo AI assistant based on the current context. It consist in a link that starts with https://4geeks.com/ask?query= and the query is the current question to make to the Rigo AI assistant. Keep in mind that the query must be always in this syntax: this-is-a-question. The question should be in lower case and without special characters, separated by hyphens. The question should be good enough to  guide the AI to provide a meaningful answer, not just a vague question, provide specific details on what and how to explain to the student.
    goodFor:
      - providing hints
      - AI assistance
      - learning support
    avoid:
      - overuse
      - should be used sparingly to encourage independent thinking

  - name: code_comparison
    intendedUse:
      - comparing code versions
      - showing bug fixes or improvements
      - demonstrating different algorithmic approaches
    description: >-
      Compare two code blocks side-by-side to show improvements, bug fixes, refactoring, or different approaches to solve the same problem. This is the most common comparison use case.
    goodFor:
      - showing before/after code improvements
      - comparing simple vs optimized implementations
      - demonstrating bug fixes with validation
      - contrasting iterative vs functional approaches
      - showing different coding patterns or best practices
    whenToUse: Use when comparing two versions of code enhances learning. Perfect for teaching refactoring, debugging, optimization, or comparing different solutions to the same problem. For HTML/CSS comparisons, prefer html_comparison which offers both visual and code comparison modes.
    avoid:
      - comparing unrelated code snippets
      - very long code blocks (keep focused on the key differences)
      - more than one concept per comparison
      - HTML code (use html_comparison instead for better flexibility with raw/rendered modes)
    rules:
      - CRITICAL - NEVER use this for HTML code, always use html_comparison component instead
      - CRITICAL - Must use exactly "---SEPARATOR---" on its own line to divide the two code blocks
      - type="code" is REQUIRED
      - language attribute is REQUIRED (e.g. language="python", language="javascript")
      - NEVER set language="html" - use html_comparison component instead
      - Use descriptive leftLabel and rightLabel to guide the student
      - Keep both code blocks similar in length for best visual results
    metadata:
      - type - Must be "code"
      - language - REQUIRED - Programming language (python, javascript, java, etc.) NEVER "html"
      - leftLabel - Recommended - Label for left panel (e.g. "Basic Version", "With Bug")
      - rightLabel - Recommended - Label for right panel (e.g. "Optimized", "Fixed Version")
    example: |
      ```comparison type="code" language="python" leftLabel="Simple Version" rightLabel="With Validation"
      def factorial(n):
          result = 1
          for i in range(1, n + 1):
              result *= i
          return result

      ---SEPARATOR---

      def factorial(n):
          """Calculate factorial with validation."""
          if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:
              raise ValueError("Must be a positive integer")
          if n == 0 or n == 1:
              return 1
          return n * factorial(n - 1)
      ```
      --- Second Example ---

      ```comparison type="code" language="javascript" leftLabel="With Bug" rightLabel="Fixed"
      function greet(name) {
          console.log("Hello " + name)
      }
      greet() // Hello undefined

      ---SEPARATOR---

      function greet(name) {
          if (!name) {
              console.log("Hello, stranger!");
              return;
          }
          console.log("Hello " + name);
      }
      greet() // Hello, stranger!
      ```

  - name: html_comparison
    intendedUse:
      - comparing visual designs
      - showing CSS improvements
      - demonstrating UI changes with slider
      - comparing HTML structure and semantics
    description: >-
      Compare two HTML/CSS implementations. This component handles both visual comparisons (using an interactive slider) and code structure comparisons (using side-by-side layout with raw mode). ALWAYS use this for any HTML content, never use code_comparison for HTML.
    goodFor:
      - showing before/after design improvements
      - comparing different CSS layout techniques (Flexbox vs Grid)
      - demonstrating responsive design changes
      - visual UI enhancements and styling improvements
      - comparing HTML structure and element placement
      - showing semantic HTML differences (accessibility, attributes, form structure)
      - demonstrating different approaches to the same markup
    whenToUse: ALWAYS use this component for ANY HTML/CSS comparison, whether the focus is visual design or code structure. By default, it shows an interactive slider for visual comparisons. For code-focused comparisons (structure, semantics, attributes), add layout="side-by-side" with leftInitialMode="raw" and rightInitialMode="raw".
    avoid:
      - comparing completely different page structures (focus on similar layouts)
    rules:
      - CRITICAL - Must use exactly "---SEPARATOR---" on its own line to divide the two HTML blocks
      - type="html" is REQUIRED
      - Use descriptive leftLabel and rightLabel to describe each version
      - Both HTML blocks should represent comparable designs for best effect
      - Use layout="side-by-side" with leftInitialMode="raw" and rightInitialMode="raw" when comparing code structure, not visual results
      - Can force layout="side-by-side" if you prefer code comparison over visual slider
    metadata:
      - type - Must be "html"
      - leftLabel - Recommended - Label for left panel (e.g. "Basic Design", "Flexbox")
      - rightLabel - Recommended - Label for right panel (e.g. "Enhanced", "CSS Grid")
      - layout - Optional - Use "side-by-side" to force code comparison instead of slider
      - leftInitialMode - Optional - Set to "raw" to start left panel in code mode (defaults to "rendered")
      - rightInitialMode - Optional - Set to "raw" to start right panel in code mode (defaults to "rendered")
    example: |
      ```comparison type="html" leftLabel="Basic Styles" rightLabel="Enhanced Design"

  - name: code_vs_rendered
    intendedUse:
      - teaching markup syntax (Markdown, Mermaid)
      - showing source code and its rendered output
    description: >-
      Show source code on one side and its rendered output on the other. Perfect for teaching Markdown or Mermaid syntax by displaying the raw code and final result simultaneously.
    goodFor:
      - teaching Markdown syntax
      - teaching Mermaid diagram syntax
      - showing how markup translates to visual output
    whenToUse: Use when teaching syntax where seeing both the source and rendered result together enhances understanding. Set different initial modes for each panel and disable sync.
    avoid:
      - when simple code-only comparison is sufficient
      - for HTML (where preview is already obvious)
    rules:
      - CRITICAL - Must use exactly "---SEPARATOR---" on its own line (can use same content on both sides)
      - type must be "mermaid" or "markdown"
      - MUST set leftInitialMode="raw" and rightInitialMode="rendered"
      - MUST set syncRenderToggle="false" to allow independent panel control
      - Both sides typically contain the SAME content (shown differently)
    metadata:
      - type - Must be "mermaid" or "markdown"
      - leftLabel - Recommended - Usually "Source Code" or "Markdown Code"
      - rightLabel - Recommended - Usually "Rendered Output" or "Result"
      - leftInitialMode - REQUIRED - Must be "raw"
      - rightInitialMode - REQUIRED - Must be "rendered"
      - syncRenderToggle - REQUIRED - Must be "false"
    example: |
      ```comparison type="mermaid" leftLabel="Mermaid Code" rightLabel="Rendered Diagram" leftInitialMode="raw" rightInitialMode="rendered" syncRenderToggle="false"

  - name: image
    intendedUse:
      - educational explanation
      - diagrammatic visualization that improves content comprehension
    description: >-
      Images must be educational and explanatory, designed to enhance understanding of concepts.
      They should be diagrammatic in nature, using visual elements like arrows, labels, numbered steps,
      annotations, and clear visual hierarchies to explain processes, relationships, or structures.
      Images must provide real educational value beyond what text alone can convey. Each image is 
      generated from a descriptive alt text that acts as a detailed prompt for AI, specifying the 
      educational elements and diagrammatic features needed.
    goodFor:
      - process flows with labeled steps
      - system architecture diagrams
      - concept relationships with arrows and connections
      - data structure visualizations
      - comparative diagrams showing before/after or different approaches
      - annotated technical illustrations
      - step-by-step visual guides with numbered elements
    whenToUse: Only when the visual representation significantly improves comprehension compared to text or code alone. Use when explaining relationships between components, sequential processes, spatial arrangements, hierarchical structures, or when comparing multiple concepts visually. The image must answer the question "How does this help the student understand better than text?"
    avoid:
      - purely decorative images
      - generic stock photos without educational annotations
      - images that merely illustrate what the text already says clearly
      - artistic or abstract images without clear educational purpose
      - screenshots without annotations or highlights
      - images where a mermaid diagram or code example would be clearer
      - overly complex visuals that confuse rather than clarify
    rules:
      - Should use standard markdown image syntax => ![alt text](image-url)
      - The alt text must contain a detailed prompt with at least 30 words describing the educational and diagrammatic elements of the image
      - The alt text must specify visual teaching elements like "with arrows showing", "labeled with", "numbered steps", "annotated to highlight", "color-coded to differentiate"
      - The alt text should describe what the student will learn from the image, not just what it looks like
      - The image URL must always start with "./.learn/assets/" and contain a meaningful descriptive filename
      - Images must be directly relevant to the learning objective and add value beyond the text
      - Every image should be explanatory and diagrammatic with clear labels, annotations, or visual guides
      - Prefer diagrams with educational annotations over plain illustrations
      - Include visual cues like arrows, numbers, labels, highlights, or color coding to guide understanding
    example: |
      ![A technical diagram illustrating the HTTP request-response cycle between client and server, with numbered steps from 1 to 5, arrows showing data flow direction, labels identifying DNS resolution, TCP connection, request headers, server processing, and response payload, color-coded to differentiate client-side actions in blue and server-side actions in green, with annotations explaining each component's role in the process](./.learn/assets/http-request-response-diagram.png)
