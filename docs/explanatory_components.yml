      Mermaid diagrams allow you to create various types of diagrams including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and more. The component renders Mermaid syntax into interactive diagrams.
    goodFor:
      - visualization
      - process explanation
      - system architecture
      - data flow
    whenToUse: Use it only when the diagram
    avoid:
      - complex diagrams that might not render well
      - use for simple to medium complexity diagrams
    rules:
      - NEVER under ANY circumstances use or write parentheses inside [] because it will break the mermaid syntax and won't render properly
    example: |
      ```mermaid
      graph TD
          A[Start] --> B{Is it working?}
          B -->|Yes| C[Great!]
          B -->|No| D[Debug]
          D --> B
      ```

      The Ask Rigo button provides AI-powered assistance for quizzes and tests. It allows users to get hints and help from the Rigo AI assistant based on the current context. It consist in a link that starts with https://4geeks.com/ask?query= and the query is the current question to make to the Rigo AI assistant. Keep in mind that the query must be always in this syntax: this-is-a-question. The question should be in lower case and without special characters, separated by hyphens. The question should be good enough to  guide the AI to provide a meaningful answer, not just a vague question, provide specific details on what and how to explain to the student.
    goodFor:
      - providing hints
      - AI assistance
      - learning support
    avoid:
      - overuse
      - should be used sparingly to encourage independent thinking
    usage: Automatically appears in quiz and test components, no manual configuration needed

  - name: comparison
    intendedUse:
      - explanation
      - educational comparison
      - code improvement demonstration
      - side-by-side or slider visualization
    description: >-
      The comparison component allows side-by-side or slider-based comparison of two pieces of content.
      It supports multiple content types including HTML previews, code with syntax highlighting, text,
      Mermaid diagrams, Markdown rendering, and images. Perfect for showing code improvements, design changes,
      or comparing different approaches to solve the same problem. The component automatically selects the best
      layout based on content type: slider for visual content (HTML, images) and side-by-side for textual/code content.
    goodFor:
      - showing code improvements through refactoring or bug fixes
      - comparing correct vs incorrect implementations
      - demonstrating design improvements (images, HTML)
      - comparing simple vs detailed prompts or explanations
      - showing Mermaid diagram code vs rendered output (using leftDefaultMode="raw" and rightDefaultMode="rendered")
      - showing Markdown source vs rendered output (using different defaultMode for each panel)
      - comparing different algorithms or approaches side by side
      - visual demonstrations of UI changes or variations
      - comparing code with different levels of complexity or optimization
    whenToUse: Use when showing two versions or variations of something enhances learning - comparing approaches, demonstrating improvements, or showing different solutions to the same problem. Particularly effective for code quality improvements, bug fixes, design iterations, or when teaching best practices by contrasting different examples.
    avoid:
      - comparing more than 2 items (component only supports 2 panels)
      - using for unrelated content that doesn't benefit from comparison
      - overusing in a single lesson (can be overwhelming, use sparingly)
      - very long code blocks that make scrolling difficult (keep comparisons focused)
      - using when a simple explanation would be clearer
    rules:
      - CRITICAL - Must use exactly the text "---SEPARATOR---" on its own line to divide the two content blocks
      - The type attribute is REQUIRED and must be one of these values - html, text, code, mermaid, markdown, image
      - For type="code", you MUST also specify the language attribute (e.g. language="python", language="javascript")
      - Both content blocks should be comparable in length and complexity for best visual results
      - Use descriptive left and right labels to guide the student and provide context
      - For images, use full URLs or paths starting with ./.learn/assets/
      - Keep the compared content focused on a single concept or improvement
      - The separator must be on its own line with no extra spaces or characters
      - To show code vs rendered output, use leftDefaultMode="raw" and rightDefaultMode="rendered" with syncModes="false"
      - When using different defaultModes, consider setting syncModes="false" so each panel can be toggled independently
    metadata:
      - type - Content type (REQUIRED) - Must be one of html, text, code, mermaid, markdown, image
      - language - Programming language (REQUIRED only for type="code") - python, javascript, java, etc
      - left - Label for left panel (optional but recommended) - Describes what the left content represents
      - right - Label for right panel (optional but recommended) - Describes what the right content represents
      - layout - Force specific layout (optional) - "slider" for overlay comparison or "side-by-side" for split view. Auto-detected if omitted
      - height - Component height (optional) - Default is "600px", accepts CSS values like "500px", "80vh", "700px"
      - syncModes - Sync render/code toggle between panels (optional) - "true" or "false", default is "true"
      - leftDefaultMode - Initial display mode for left panel (optional) - "rendered" or "raw". Defaults to first available mode for the content type
      - rightDefaultMode - Initial display mode for right panel (optional) - "rendered" or "raw". Defaults to first available mode for the content type
    example: |
      ```comparison type="html" left="Versión simple" right="Versión mejorada"
      <h1>Título básico</h1>
      <p>Párrafo sin formato</p>

      ---SEPARATOR---

      <style>
        h1 { color: #2563eb; font-size: 2rem; }
        p { font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; }
      </style>
      <h1>Título estilizado</h1>
      <p>Párrafo con formato mejorado</p>
      ```
      --- Second Example ---

      ```comparison type="code" language="python" left="Versión básica" right="Versión optimizada"
      def find_max(numbers):
          sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
          return sorted_numbers[-1]

      ---SEPARATOR---

      def find_max(numbers):
          return max(numbers)
      ```
      --- Third Example ---

      ```comparison type="text" left="Versión simple" right="Versión detallada" height="400px"
      Explica las funciones en Python

      ---SEPARATOR---

      Explica las funciones en Python de forma clara:
      - Sintaxis para definir funciones
      - Cómo usar parámetros y argumentos
      - Valores de retorno con return
      - Ejemplos prácticos aplicados
      ```
      --- Fourth Example ---
      
      ```comparison type="code" language="javascript" left="Versión con bucle" right="Versión con método"
      function sumArray(arr) {
          let sum = 0;
          for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
              sum = sum + arr[i];
          }
          return sum;
      }

      ---SEPARATOR---

      function sumArray(arr) {
          return arr.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
      }
      ```
      --- Fifth Example (with different initial modes) ---
      
      ```comparison type="mermaid" left="Mermaid Code" right="Rendered Diagram" syncModes="false" leftDefaultMode="raw" rightDefaultMode="rendered"
      graph TD
          A[Start] --> B{Decision}
          B -->|Yes| C[Action 1]
          B -->|No| D[Action 2]
          C --> E[End]
          D --> E
      
      ---SEPARATOR---
      
      graph TD
          A[Start] --> B{Decision}
          B -->|Yes| C[Action 1]
          B -->|No| D[Action 2]
          C --> E[End]
          D --> E
      ```

  - name: image
    intendedUse:
      - educational explanation
      - diagrammatic visualization that improves content comprehension
    description: >-
      Images must be educational and explanatory, designed to enhance understanding of concepts.
      They should be diagrammatic in nature, using visual elements like arrows, labels, numbered steps,
      annotations, and clear visual hierarchies to explain processes, relationships, or structures.
      Images must provide real educational value beyond what text alone can convey. Each image is 
      generated from a descriptive alt text that acts as a detailed prompt for AI, specifying the 
      educational elements and diagrammatic features needed.
    goodFor:
      - process flows with labeled steps
      - system architecture diagrams
      - concept relationships with arrows and connections
      - data structure visualizations
      - comparative diagrams showing before/after or different approaches
      - annotated technical illustrations
      - step-by-step visual guides with numbered elements
    whenToUse: Only when the visual representation significantly improves comprehension compared to text or code alone. Use when explaining relationships between components, sequential processes, spatial arrangements, hierarchical structures, or when comparing multiple concepts visually. The image must answer the question "How does this help the student understand better than text?"
    avoid:
      - purely decorative images
      - generic stock photos without educational annotations
      - images that merely illustrate what the text already says clearly
      - artistic or abstract images without clear educational purpose
      - screenshots without annotations or highlights
      - images where a mermaid diagram or code example would be clearer
      - overly complex visuals that confuse rather than clarify
    rules:
      - Should use standard markdown image syntax => ![alt text](image-url)
      - The alt text must contain a detailed prompt with at least 30 words describing the educational and diagrammatic elements of the image
      - The alt text must specify visual teaching elements like "with arrows showing", "labeled with", "numbered steps", "annotated to highlight", "color-coded to differentiate"
      - The alt text should describe what the student will learn from the image, not just what it looks like
      - The image URL must always start with "./.learn/assets/" and contain a meaningful descriptive filename
      - Images must be directly relevant to the learning objective and add value beyond the text
      - Every image should be explanatory and diagrammatic with clear labels, annotations, or visual guides
      - Prefer diagrams with educational annotations over plain illustrations
      - Include visual cues like arrows, numbers, labels, highlights, or color coding to guide understanding
    example: |
      ![A technical diagram illustrating the HTTP request-response cycle between client and server, with numbered steps from 1 to 5, arrows showing data flow direction, labels identifying DNS resolution, TCP connection, request headers, server processing, and response payload, color-coded to differentiate client-side actions in blue and server-side actions in green, with annotations explaining each component's role in the process](./.learn/assets/http-request-response-diagram.png)
