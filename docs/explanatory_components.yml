  - name: mermaid-diagram
    intentedUse: explanation, complementary to the main content
    description: >-
      Mermaid diagrams allow you to create various types of diagrams including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and more. The component renders Mermaid syntax into interactive diagrams.
    goodFor: visualization, process explanation, system architecture, data flow.
    whenToUse: Use it only when the diagram
    avoid: complex diagrams that might not render well, use for simple to medium complexity diagrams
    rules: 
      - NEVER under ANY circumstances use write parentheses inside [] because it will break the mermaid syntax and won't render properly
    example: |
      ```mermaid
      graph TD
          A[Start] --> B{Is it working?}
          B -->|Yes| C[Great!]
          B -->|No| D[Debug]
          D --> B
      ```

  - name: ask-rigo-button
    intentedUse: explanation, complementary to the main content
    description: >-
      The Ask Rigo button provides AI-powered assistance for quizzes and tests. It allows users to get hints and help from the Rigo AI assistant based on the current context. It consist in a link that starts with https://4geeks.com/ask?query= and the query is the current question to make to the Rigo AI assistant.
    goodFor: providing hints, AI assistance, learning support
    avoid: overuse, should be used sparingly to encourage independent thinking
    usage: Automatically appears in quiz and test components, no manual configuration needed
    example: |
      [Ask Rigo about HTML](https://4geeks.com/ask?query=What is the purpose of HTML?)

  - name: runnable-code
    intentedUse: code experimentation, immediate feedback, understand code.
    description: >-
      Code blocks with the runnable metadata that can be executed directly in the browser. Users can run the code and see the output, making it interactive for learning programming concepts.
    goodFor: code experimentation, immediate feedback, understand code.
    avoid: complex code that might not run in the browser environment easily, this is intended only for demostrative purposes.
    example: |
      ```javascript runnable="true"
      console.log("Hello, World!");
      let x = 5;
      let y = 10;
      console.log(x + y);
      ```

  - name: code-file-proposal
    intentedUse: hands-on learning, code experimentation, immediate feedback on code execution, this renders in a separate tab where the student can edit the code file. The student will see all the files from the lessons. So you need to suggest as many files as needed for the exercise.
    description: >-
      A code file proposal is a component the teacher will use to generate a coding files used to solve an exercise in the instructions, it consists in a markdown code block with the language set to `code-file-proposal`. Inside the code block, you must write a 5 to 10 sentences description of the exercise. It has a metadata property file_name in the metadata section of the code block with the name of the file to be generated, including  the extension. Keep in mind that for HTML, CSS and Javascript files, the code is executed directly in the browser, for other programming languages, the code executing will be inferred by an AI model. Prefer a single file instead of multiple ones per lesson. But if multiple files are needed, suggest them all.

    avoid: complex code that might not be inferred correctly by an AI model. 
    example: |
      ```code-file-proposal file_name="app.js"
      In this file, the student needs to complete a function "multiply" that multiplies two numbers and print the result to the console.
      ```

      ```code-file-proposal file_name="app.css"
      In this file, the student needs to style the HTML page with CSS.
      ```

      ```code-file-proposal file_name="app.html"
      In this file, the student needs to create a simple HTML page with a title and a paragraph. This page is linked to the app.css file and the app.js files.
      ```

  - name: image
    intendedUse: educational explanation and diagrammatic visualization that improves content comprehension
    description: >-
      Images must be educational and explanatory, designed to enhance understanding of concepts.
      They should be diagrammatic in nature, using visual elements like arrows, labels, numbered steps,
      annotations, and clear visual hierarchies to explain processes, relationships, or structures.
      Images must provide real educational value beyond what text alone can convey. Each image is 
      generated from a descriptive alt text that acts as a detailed prompt for AI, specifying the 
      educational elements and diagrammatic features needed.
    goodFor: process flows with labeled steps, system architecture diagrams, concept relationships with arrows and connections, data structure visualizations, comparative diagrams showing before/after or different approaches, annotated technical illustrations, step-by-step visual guides with numbered elements
    whenToUse: Only when the visual representation significantly improves comprehension compared to text or code alone. Use when explaining relationships between components, sequential processes, spatial arrangements, hierarchical structures, or when comparing multiple concepts visually. The image must answer the question "How does this help the student understand better than text?"
    avoid: purely decorative images, generic stock photos without educational annotations, images that merely illustrate what the text already says clearly, artistic or abstract images without clear educational purpose, screenshots without annotations or highlights, images where a mermaid diagram or code example would be clearer, overly complex visuals that confuse rather than clarify
    rules: 
      - Use standard markdown image syntax: "![alt text](image-url)"
      - The alt text must contain a detailed prompt with at least 30 words describing the educational and diagrammatic elements
      - The alt text must specify visual teaching elements like "with arrows showing", "labeled with", "numbered steps", "annotated to highlight", "color-coded to differentiate"
      - The alt text should describe what the student will learn from the image, not just what it looks like
      - The image URL must always start with "./.learn/assets/" and contain a meaningful descriptive filename
      - Images must be directly relevant to the learning objective and add value beyond the text
      - Every image should be explanatory and diagrammatic with clear labels, annotations, or visual guides
      - Prefer diagrams with educational annotations over plain illustrations
      - Include visual cues like arrows, numbers, labels, highlights, or color coding to guide understanding
    example: |
      ![A technical diagram illustrating the HTTP request-response cycle between client and server, with numbered steps from 1 to 5, arrows showing data flow direction, labels identifying DNS resolution, TCP connection, request headers, server processing, and response payload, color-coded to differentiate client-side actions in blue and server-side actions in green, with annotations explaining each component's role in the process](./.learn/assets/http-request-response-diagram.png)
