      The open text question is a type of interactive question where users can write down a text answer (1-5 sentences). The component consists in a markdown code block with the language set to `question` and has a metadata property eval in the metadata section of the code block with instructions on how to evaluate the answer. Inside the code block, you must write down 3-5 example answers with CORRECT: or INCORRECT: prefix. The actual question must be written outside the code block so the user can see it.
    goodFor: reflection, explanation, recall
    avoid: multiple choice, true/false, fill in the blank, this component is intended only for free form answers

      Quizzes or multiple choice questions are a great way to test the knowledge of the user. They are a great way to make the user think and to make the lesson more interactive. In LearnPack, the quizzes are rendered from task list syntax.

      ### Rules

      1. Each group of options should have a question that is a list item, numbered or not, separated by an empty line from the options.
      2. Each group of options must have an unique correct answer marked with [x]
      3. Each option should be a checkbox indented by 3 to 6 spaces, this is important for the parsing from markdown to HTML.
      4. It must be an empty line between the question title and the options. This is important for the parsing from markdown to HTML.

    goodFor: reflection, explanation, recall, knowledge assessment
    avoid: open text question, this component is intended only for multiple choice answers with an unique correct answer per group of options
    example: |

      ### Put your knowledge to the test!
      Select the correct answer for each question.


      1. Question number 1 (This is the title for the group of questions)
        <!-- Each group of options should have an empty line between the question title and the options -->

        - [ ] Incorrect option
        - [ ] Incorrect option
        - [x] Correct option (This is the correct answer)

      2. Question number 2
        <!-- Each group of options should have an empty line between the question title and the options -->
        - [ ] Incorrect option
        - [x] Correct option
        - [ ] Incorrect option


      --- Second Example ---

      - Question number 1

        - [x] Correct option
        - [ ] Incorrect option
        - [ ] Incorrect option

      - Question number 2

        - [ ] Incorrect option
        - [x] Correct option
        - [ ] Incorrect option

      A fill in the blank is a component that allows the user to fill in the blank with the correct answer. It consists in a markdown code block with the language set to `fill_in_the_blank`. Inside the code block, you must write the question with the blank (or blanks) to be filled. Each blank consist in _1_, _2_, _3_, etc. In the metadata section, you must include the valid answers for each blank. The blanks are numbered starting from 1. Case insensitive answers are allowed. If multiple answer are alloed for a blank, you must include them separated by a comma in the proper metadata property.
    goodFor: reflection, explanation, recall, knowledge assessment
    avoid: open text question, this component is intended only for fill in the blank answers
    example: |
      ### Let's recall!
      
      ```fill_in_the_blank 1="Paris" 2="Berlin"
      The capital of France is _1_, the capital of Germany is _2_.
      ```

      ### Are you really learning? Let's check it!

      Complete the sentence with number of hours of sleep per day that are recommended based on the lesson.

      ```fill_in_the_blank 1="7,8,9,10" 
      I need to sleep at least _1_ hours a day to be healthy.
      ```
