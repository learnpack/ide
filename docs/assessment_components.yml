      The open text question is a type of interactive question where users can write down a text answer (1-5 sentences). The component consists in a markdown code block with the language set to `question` and has a metadata property eval in the metadata section of the code block with instructions on how to evaluate the answer. Inside the code block, you must write down 3-5 example answers with CORRECT: or INCORRECT: prefix. The actual question must be written outside the code block so the user can see it.
    goodFor: reflection, explanation, recall
    avoid: multiple choice, true/false, fill in the blank, this component is intended only for free form answers
    props:
      - eval: string (required)

      This is a set of questions, from 1 to 5 questions, each one with multiple options. The component leverages task-list syntax to render the quiz. Each group of options should have a question title separated by an empty line from the options. Each option should be indented by 3 to 6 spaces for proper parsing from markdown to HTML.  Keep in mind that quizzes must NOT be wrapped in a code block, they should be written directly in the markdown file without any wrapping. If you wrap the quiz in a code block, the component will not be able to render it and it will not work.

      A fill in the blank is a component that allows the user to fill in the blank with the correct answer. It consists in a markdown code block with the language set to `fill_in_the_blank`. Inside the code block, you must write the question with the blank (or blanks) to be filled. Each blank consist in _1_, _2_, _3_, etc. In the metadata section, you must include the valid answers for each blank. The blanks are numbered starting from 1. Case insensitive answers are allowed. If multiple answer are alloed for a blank, you must include them separated by a comma in the proper metadata property.
